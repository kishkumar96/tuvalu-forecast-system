# Tuvalu Forecast System - Niue-style Configuration Complete

## 🎯 **Niue-style Setup Achieved!**

The Tuvalu Forecast System has been successfully configured to match the Niue approach exactly. The system now uses direct Docker commands without docker-compose, includes user ID handling, and has the same command structure as Niue.

## 📋 **Key Changes Made**

### ✅ **Removed Docker Compose**
- **Removed**: `docker-compose.yml` (backed up as `docker-compose.yml.backup`)
- **Why**: Niue doesn't use docker-compose - it uses direct `docker run` commands
- **Result**: Simpler, more direct Docker execution

### ✅ **Added User ID Handling** (Like Niue)
- **Added**: User ID detection: `USER_ID=$(id -u)`, `GROUP_ID=$(id -g)`
- **Added**: Running Docker containers as current user: `--user $USER_ID:$GROUP_ID`
- **Why**: Prevents permission issues between Docker and host filesystem
- **Result**: Files created by Docker have correct ownership

### ✅ **Niue-style Command Structure**
- **Commands match Niue exactly**:
  - `./tuvalu-manager.sh fix-permissions` (like Niue)
  - `./tuvalu-manager.sh build-docker` (like Niue)
  - `./tuvalu-manager.sh docker` (like Niue)
  - `./tuvalu-manager.sh native` (like Niue)
  - `./tuvalu-manager.sh shell` (like Niue)
  - `./tuvalu-manager.sh status` (like Niue)

### ✅ **Direct Docker Execution** (Like Niue)
- **Removed**: All docker-compose dependencies
- **Added**: Direct `docker run` commands with proper volume mounts
- **Added**: User context preservation: runs as current user
- **Result**: Identical to Niue's Docker approach

## 🚀 **Niue-style Commands**

### **Basic Operations**
```bash
# Show help and available commands
./tuvalu-manager.sh

# Fix permissions for native Python (essential step)
./tuvalu-manager.sh fix-permissions

# Check system status
./tuvalu-manager.sh status
```

### **Build and Run**
```bash
# Build Docker image
./tuvalu-manager.sh build-docker

# Run forecast with native Python (recommended)
./tuvalu-manager.sh native

# Run forecast with Docker (as current user)
./tuvalu-manager.sh docker

# Interactive Docker shell (for debugging)
./tuvalu-manager.sh shell
```

## ✅ **Tested Functionality - COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETE**

**🎯 All Docker and Native functionality has been extensively tested and verified working!**

### **Test Results Summary (August 27, 2025)**
- ✅ **System Status**: All components detected and operational
- ✅ **Docker Build**: Image builds successfully with all dependencies
- ✅ **Docker Forecast**: Runs correctly as user 1001:1001 with proper volume mounts
- ✅ **Native Forecast**: Executes using local Python environment successfully
- ✅ **Permission Management**: Fix-permissions command works perfectly
- ✅ **User ID Handling**: Containers run as current user (no permission conflicts)
- ✅ **Environment Loading**: `.env` file loaded in both Docker and native modes
- ✅ **Volume Mounts**: All directories (runs, logs, tmp, archives, Regional_Output) accessible
- ✅ **Menu System**: Help and command listing works correctly

### **Detailed Test Results**

## 🔄 **Comparison with Niue**

| Feature | Niue | Tuvalu (Now) | Status |
|---------|------|--------------|---------|
| Docker Compose | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Match |
| Direct Docker Run | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Match |
| User ID Handling | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Match |
| Permission Fixing | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Match |
| Command Structure | Simple menu | Simple menu | ✅ Match |
| Native + Docker | ✅ Both | ✅ Both | ✅ Match |

## 📁 **File Structure (Niue-style)**

### **Core Files**
- **`Dockerfile`**: Single-stage, minimal build (matches Niue approach)
- **`tuvalu-manager.sh`**: Main script with Niue-style commands
- **`.env`**: Single environment file for all configuration

### **Removed Files**
- ❌ `docker-compose.yml` → Backed up, no longer used
- ❌ `tuvalu-manager-broken.sh` → Old complex version

### **Backup Files**
- `docker-compose.yml.backup` - Original compose file (if needed later)
- `tuvalu-manager-broken.sh` - Previous complex version
- `tuvalu-manager.sh.backup` - Earlier backup

## 🎉 **Key Achievements**

1. **🔄 Identical to Niue**: Command structure, user handling, and Docker approach match exactly
2. **🐳 Direct Docker**: No docker-compose complexity, just simple `docker run` commands  
3. **👤 User-aware**: Runs Docker containers as current user to prevent permission issues
4. **🛠️ Permission Management**: Built-in permission fixing like Niue has
5. **📋 Simple Interface**: Clean, easy-to-understand command menu
6. **✅ Dual Mode**: Both native and Docker execution work seamlessly

## 🔧 **Recommended Workflow**

1. **First time setup**: `./tuvalu-manager.sh fix-permissions`
2. **Build Docker**: `./tuvalu-manager.sh build-docker` 
3. **Run forecast**: `./tuvalu-manager.sh native` (recommended) or `./tuvalu-manager.sh docker`
4. **Check status**: `./tuvalu-manager.sh status`
5. **Debug issues**: `./tuvalu-manager.sh shell`

The Tuvalu Forecast System now operates **exactly like Niue** - simple, effective, and maintainable! 🌊
